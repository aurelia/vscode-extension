## Installation
To see syntax highlighting of the Aurelia syntax you need to have a theme installed that has scope colors for html.au.

The default themes don't contain this scope, so we created 4 new themes which are clones of the default ones, 
but have support for Aurelia syntax highlighting.

You can select them by clicking on : 

[File] / [Preferences] / [Color theme] 

and pick any of the following themes:

- Aurelia Dark
- Aurelia Dark+
- Aurelia Light
- Aurelia Light+

If you want to build a custom theme, [read here](https://github.com/aurelia/vscode-extension/wiki/Creating-a-customized-theme-with-Aurelia-syntax-support) how to add support for the Aurelia syntax.
